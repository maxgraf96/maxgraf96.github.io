My current research as a PhD student in AI & Music is located at the 
intersection of symbolic music prediction systems, mixed reality technology and
human-computer interaction. 

I am exploring the use of transformer-based artificial neural networks for conditional generation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI" target="_blank">MIDI</a> data. These models are integrated into digital musical instruments
in a mixed reality environment. My goals are to identify the utility of these models for musical co-creation
between people and machines.
