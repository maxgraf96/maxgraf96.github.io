My research is located at the intersection of artificial intelligence, mixed reality technology and human-computer interaction.
In the past I have worked on the collaborative design of a novel mixed reality musical instrument with a jazz 
pianist.
Currently, I am working on improving hand-tracking technology for mixed reality applications using surface 
electromyography devices.
