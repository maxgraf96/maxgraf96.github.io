        I am a PhD researcher in AI & Music at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London.
        My research, supervised by Mathieu Barthet and Andrew McPherson, is located at the intersection of symbolic music prediction systems, mixed reality technology and
        human-computer interaction.<br />
        Previously I completed a MSc in Sound and Music Computing at the same university.
