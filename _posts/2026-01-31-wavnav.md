# WavNav — Audio Sample Discovery Reimagined

**WavNav** is a professional audio sample discovery application that transforms how music producers and sound designers explore their sample libraries. Instead of scrolling through endless folder hierarchies, WavNav presents your samples as an **interactive 2D map** — similar samples cluster together, and you navigate visually.

## What It Does

- **Visual Exploration** — Your entire sample library mapped in 2D space; similar sounds appear close together
- **AI-Powered Embeddings** — Uses neural audio embeddings to understand sound similarity
- **Real-Time Clustering** — DBSCAN clustering groups samples into meaningful categories
- **Interactive Navigation** — Pan, zoom, and click to audition samples instantly
- **Cross-Platform** — Native macOS app (Apple Silicon optimized), with Windows coming soon

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Core** | C++20, JUCE 8 framework |
| **Graphics** | OpenGL (FeaturePlane renderer) |
| **UI Layer** | JUCE WebView with HTML/JS/CSS overlay |
| **ML/Audio** | libtorch, custom embedding pipeline |
| **Search** | FAISS for similarity search |

## Status

- ✅ **macOS (Apple Silicon)** — Fully functional, 3 releases tagged
- 🔄 **Embedding Pipeline** — Migrating to LAION CLAP for on-device inference
- 📋 **Windows** — Planned
