*Abstract*:\
Computer-generated visualisations can accompany recorded or live music to create novel audiovisual experiences for
audiences. We present a system to streamline the creation of audio-driven visualisations based on audio feature
extraction and mapping interfaces. Its architecture is based on three modular software components: backend (audio
plugin), frontend (3D game-like environment), and middleware (visual mapping interface). We conducted a user evaluation
comprising two stages. Results from the first stage (34 participants) indicate that music visualisations generated with
the system were significantly better at complementing the music than a baseline visualisation. Nine participants took
part in the second stage involving interactive tasks. Overall, the system yielded a Creativity Support Index above
average (68.1) and a System Usability Scale index (58.6) suggesting that ease of use can be improved. Thematic analysis
revealed that participants enjoyed the system’s synchronicity and expressive capabilities, but found technical problems
and difficulties understanding the audio feature terminology.
